"""
This module handles all of the downloading to disk, and parses whatever
filters were passed down from the config

My first priority is finding the best matching resolution when the user specifies it. Then, the container (mp4/webm) has to match the audio codec so we can combine them. The absolute basic default is to download the highest resolution video and audio. If we download by resolution we can use stream.includes_audio_track to decide if we have to find a matching audio track.

I could maybe make other types of downloads available. I think a possible one is like a metadata and another one is like the js. Could be useful
