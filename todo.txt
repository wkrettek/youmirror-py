Core
    Envelope some of the code into functions elsewhere
    We should probably wrap the objects sooner
Parser
    Make it clearer when the pytube objects are what they are
    Parse the object type early on and send it down the right path
    Be able to rip all the metadata
        -Somehow rip just enough not to cause any errors.. I guess just skip metadata we can't get that's not crucial
Helper
    Can I rename this thing??
    Will have to build the filepath
        Have to resolve somehow if there is a naming conflict... Honestly do not freaking know how. I want it to be something simple that is unobtrusive to understanding it.. And even more ideally than that.... was obviously resolved by youmirror and can be removed if need be
Databaser
    Used for the more complex db operations (if necessary)
        It will use the sqlite3 library
            Otherwise, sqlitedict is good enough for the core
remove()
    Have it do basically the same thing as add, except it removes
Downloader
    Should be very specific
        You only pass video objects when you're ready to download
        Somehow have to be able to pass all the different specifiers
